## Hey, I'm Zile 

Thanks for checking out my site! ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me -- I am currently a 3rd-year student at the University of Pennsylvania studying economics and computer science. I am a web3 fanatic and have been learning blockchain development for a little over a year. I specialize in full-stack dApp and web development, and I am always passionate about building projects in ecosystems like Solana. I am most interested in Web3 private data, decentralized science, and blockchain gaming!
